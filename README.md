### The purpose of this project is to learn how to use JS. The object was to write code for the code to do the logic in without taking the action on the server-side but to do it on the client side.
 

Challenge 17 - JavaScript
For this challenge, you will solve tasks that are used for developing logic.
Solve them in order as the weight of each subsequent task increases.
Tasks can be in one document or 3 different ones.
1. Use conditions to check if a given number is even. If so , print with
console.log â€œ The Number (TheNumberYouWrote) is even ". If the
number is not even, print " The Number (TheNumberYouWrote) is not
even".
2. Check which numbers from 10 to 100 are even and divisible by 3. Print
with console.log all those that meet these conditions.
3. From the given 3 numbers , find the smallest and largest, and check
are they prime.
Example:
Number = 13;
Number2 = 15;
Number3 = 20;
Smallest - 13 , Largest-20
The smallest number 13 is prime , The largest number 20 is not prime.
